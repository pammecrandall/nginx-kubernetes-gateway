// EventLoop is the main event loop of the Gateway. It handles events coming through the event channel.
//
// When a new event comes, there are two cases:
// - If there is no event(s) currently being handled, the new event is handled immediately.
// - Otherwise, the new event will be saved for later handling. All saved events will be handled after the handling of
// the current event(s) finishes. Multiple saved events will be handled at once -- they will be batched.
//
// Batching is needed because, because typically handling an event (or multiple events at once) will result into
// reloading NGINX, which is the operation we want to minimize, for the following reasons:
// (1) A reload takes time - at least 200ms. The time depends on the size of the configuration including the number of
// TLS certs, available CPU cycles.
// (2) A reload can have side-effects for the data plane traffic.
// FIXME(pleshakov): better document the side effects and how to prevent and mitigate them.
// So when the EventLoop have 100 saved events, it is better to process them at once rather than one by one.
